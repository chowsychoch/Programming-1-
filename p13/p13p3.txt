In the program in the previous question, what happens in each of the following cases:
(a) If you include the line print(print max())?
It will print out result and also print out 'None' in newline as function return nothing. 

(b) If you omit the brackets after print max(), ie just have print max? 
It won't return anything as it means print variable of print max which  did not have any assignment of value.


(c) If you include the line print(print max)?
<function print_max at 0x7fd787167c20>
It return function type of print_max at memory address location
